🎯 Smart Recommendation System (Movies, Songs & Games)

This is a simple yet effective Python-based recommendation system that suggests movies, songs, or games to users based on their personal preferences. The system uses basic collaborative filtering techniques to compare user ratings and recommend items that similar users liked — just like the logic behind Netflix, Spotify, or Steam suggestions.

✨ Features
	🎬 Movie, 🎵 Song, and 🎮 Game recommendations

	📊 Users give numeric ratings to items

	🧠 Uses user-user collaborative filtering to generate suggestions

	🔍 Finds similar users and recommends items you haven’t rated yet

	🔤 Handles case-insensitive input

	🔧 Easily extendable with more users, categories, or recommendation logic

⚙️ How It Works

The system:

⦁		Collects ratings from multiple users for each category.

⦁		Compares a target user’s preferences to others.

⦁		Calculates similarity using techniques like cosine similarity or Pearson correlation.

⦁		Suggests new movies, songs, or games that similar users enjoyed but the target user hasn't rated.

🧰 Technologies Used :
⦁		Python 3
⦁		Math module (for similarity calculations)
⦁		Dictionary-based data storage
⦁		Simple console I/O (no external dependencies)
